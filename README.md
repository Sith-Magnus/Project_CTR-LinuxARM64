# Project_CTR
Project CTR is a collection of custom Nintendo 3DS tools.

Forked by Sith-Magnus to add Linux ARM64 compatibilty.
Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish (Termux Proot Environment) and confirmed working. 
Why was this fork made? No reason really, saw a lot of people complaining online that there is no proper viable solution to decrypt ROMs on android. It can be effectively used along with [cia-unix by shijimasoft](https://github.com/shijimasoft/cia-unix) to decrypt 3DS ROMs over android!
 

Use:
Termux+Proot users on Android can use these updated binaries to decrypt roms directly on their smartphone, instead of having to pull out their beefy computer. 

Tutorial: 

I'll probably type this out later, so will leave it as a place-holder for now. 

Disclaimer: 
I am VERY new to github, so if I made a mistake please let me know ♥️ 

I will work on a more elegant approach soon if I get the time, so stay tuned!
